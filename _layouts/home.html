<p>Hi. Welcome to my GitHub Page. My name is Sameera Suhail and I am a graduate in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Swinburne University of Technology. Apart from this degree, I have a certificate in Data Science which focused on driving business intelligence from data and coming up with marketing strategies. I have experience in Python, R, MATLAB and C- all of which I have used to tackle actual projects.</p>  

<p>Here I have compiled a few of those projects that I have done in Electronics Engineering and Data Science. Each project has a short write up and a link to a GitHub repository with the complete code and report.</p>
